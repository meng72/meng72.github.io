I am a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Prof. [Y. Charlie Hu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ychu/) in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/). 
My research interests are in Mobile Systems and Mobile Networking with a recent focus on the systems support of emerging applications (e.g. VR/AR/MR, 360Â° Video Streaming) on the edge over 5G (and NextG). I received B.E. at School of Computer Science and Technology, [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2016.
